This repository will support our upcoming paper on the transcriptional and mutational consequences of aging in the male Drosophila germline.

The SNP database is located at https://www.dropbox.com/s/7t4b75h5uvh6lot/210603_R517_Old_Young_SNP_database.csv?dl=0 and seurat RDS for the main analysis is located at https://www.dropbox.com/s/pf1x781c7poubrp/220607_6reps.RDS?dl=0 .
Seurat RDS for the alternate TE/de novo gene reference is located at https://www.dropbox.com/s/algc8fvobs5oxhi/220607_6reps_te_denovo.RDS?dl=0

Raw sequence files for sc-RNA-seq and gDNA-seq will be released on SRA
